# Structural racism in the dental health of New Yorkers

# Abstract 
It is known that structural racism negatively affects the health of Non-white populations in the U.S. For example, it is known
that U.S. Black populations experience a higher burden of oral diseases. The objective of this project is to determine if this 
phenomenon is the same in other populations of color, specifically in New York State. We use data analysis techniques to determine if there is a relationship between a person's skin color and their dental health. We make a descriptive study of the data and provide maps that allow us to visualize the level of dental health in New York. 


# Data Collection and Pre-processing
We search for free databases on the Internet. Our goal was to find data related to the ethnography of New York State and the dental health of its inhabitants. 

The first website we consulted was the site for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
From here we found summary data regarding three categories:
- Adults aged 18+ who have visited a dentist or dental clinic in the past year
- Adults aged 65+ who have lost all of their natural teeth due to tooth decay or gum disease
- Adults aged 65+ who have lost six or more teeth due to tooth decay or gum disease

[Source 1](https://nccd.cdc.gov/oralhealthdata/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DOH_DATA.ExploreByLocation&rdProcessAction=&SaveFileGenerated=1&islLocation=36&rdICL-iclTopic=ADT&iclTopic_rdExpandedCollapsedHistory=&iclTopic=ADT&islYear=2018&hidLocation=36&hidTopic=ADT&hidYear=2018&irbShowFootnotes=Show&rdICL-iclIndicators=ADT1_1%2cADT1_3%2cADT1_4&iclIndicators_rdExpandedCollapsedHistory=&iclIndicators=ADT1_1%2cADT1_3%2cADT1_4&hidPreviouslySelectedIndicators=&DashboardColumnCount=2&rdShowElementHistory=&rdScrollX=0&rdScrollY=0&rdRnd=86496)

This data could not be exported so we made our own csv files with the information provided. 

The final website we use was the one for the Department of Health. We use the data from New York State Community Health Indicator Reports 
(CHIRS). From this, we get the following datasets in xls format:

# Data Cleaning
The whole process is documented in the notebook above, however let's explain some of the things that we did, here. 
```
def clear_data(df, name):
  #Remove unnamed columns
  cdf = df[['Region/County', 'Percentage (CI)']]
  
  #Remove rows containing the word 'Region'
  cdf = cdf[cdf["Region/County"].str.contains("Region")==False]
  
  #Remove the CI from Percentage (CI) column
  cdf["Percentage (CI)"] = cdf['Percentage (CI)'].replace("[\(\[].*?[\)\]]", "",regex=True)

  cdf = cdf.rename(columns = {'Percentage (CI)' : name}) 

  #Convert the s symbol to na
  
  cdf[name] = cdf[name].replace('s', np.nan)

  # Sort in ascending order just for better reading
  cdf = cdf.sort_values('Region/County')

  return cdf
```
Much of our data contained strings that we did not need, and missing values coded with an s. So we wrote the above function to clean such data. We used regular expressions and Pandas methods to work this out. The function above let us to pass from this
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis
We use standard Pandas functions and our statistics knowledge to ask our data for questions such as: Whats is the county with most cases of caries? Make diagrams, etc.
Here are the results.

 In this first figure we see that the difference between people who attended a dentist is notorios for white people, whereas for the other races, the difference is not that strong. So, it is more commen for white people to visit the dentist than for nonwhite people.

In this figure we see that although there is not too much teeth decay, Black and Hispanic people are more propensous to lose their teeth than white people.

In this graph it is clear that nonwhite people have better oral health after 65 years. Specially Black and Multiracial people, who were the only two groups with more positive cases of lost teeth.
